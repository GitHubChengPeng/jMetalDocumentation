##Overview

jMetal is an object-oriented Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics (http://jmetal.sourceforge.net).

After eight years since the first release of jMetal, we have decided it's time to make a deep redesign of the software. Some of the ideas we are elaborating are:

    Architecture redesign to provide a simpler design while keeping the same functionality.
    Improve code quality:
        Application of unit testing
        Better use of Java features (e.g, generics)
        Design patterns
        Application of clean code guidelines - â€œClean code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" (Robert C. Martin)
    Algorithm templates
    Parallelism support
    Maven is used as the tool for development, testing, packaging and deployment.
