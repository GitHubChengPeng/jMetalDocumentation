## Algorithm templates

Most of metaheuristic families are characterized by a common behaviour which is shared by all the algorithms belonging to the family. This behaviour can be expressed as a template that can be instatiated to implement a particular algorithm. From a software engineering point of view, an algorithm whose behavior falls in a basic template would only require to implement some specific methods for the new technique; the common behavior would not be needed to be programmed, therefore resulting in less code replication. This inversion of control if a characteristic of [software frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework), as is the case of jMetal.
