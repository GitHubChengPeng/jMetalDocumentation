##Installation
jMetal is a Maven project hosted in GitHub, so there are two ways of getting the software: adding it as a dependence in your own Maven proyect, of getting the source code from https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal.

### Using jMetal as a Maven Dependence
jMetal 5.0 is structured into four submodules:
* `jmetal-core` : Classes of the core architecture plus some utilities, including quality indicators.
* `jmetal-algorithm` : Implementations of metaheuristics.
* `jmetal-problem` : Implementations of problems.
* `jmetal-exec` : Executable programs to configure and run the algorithms plus some utilities.

These modules can be found in the [Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/):
