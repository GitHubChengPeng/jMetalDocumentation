##Motivation
After eight years since the first release of jMetal, we have decided it's time to make a deep redesign of the
software. Some of the ideas we are elaborating are:

* Maven is used as the tool for development, testing, packaging and deployment.
* Redesigned the architecture to provide a simpler design while keeping the same functionality.
* Improve the code quality:
 ** We plan to incorporate progressively unit tests to all the classes
 ** We take into account the recommendations provided in â€œClean code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" (Robert C. Martin)
 ** The Fluent Interface (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html) is applied to configure and execute
    the algorithms.
