##Motivation
After eight years since the first release of jMetal, we have decided it's time to make a deep redesign of the
software. Some of the ideas we are elaborating are:

* Architecture redesign to provide a simpler design while keeping the same functionality.
* Improve code quality:
 * Application of unit testing
 * Better use of Java features (e.g, generics)
 * Design patterns
 * Application of clean code guidelines - â€œClean code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" (Robert C. Martin)
* Algorithm templates
* Parallelism support
* Maven is used as the tool for development, testing, packaging and deployment.
